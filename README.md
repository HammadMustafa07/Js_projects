# 🚀 JavaScript Mini Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository! 👋  
This repo is a growing collection of mini projects that I’ve built to sharpen my JavaScript skills and track my progress over time.

Whether you're a fellow learner or just curious, feel free to explore, clone, and play around with these projects. 🌱

## 🔧 What’s Inside?

Here you'll find small but meaningful projects—ranging from simple DOM manipulation to slightly advanced logic—all built using plain JavaScript (sometimes with HTML/CSS for UI).

Some example project ideas include:
- ✅ To-Do App
- 🕒 Digital Clock
- 🔐 Password Generator
- 🎲 Dice Game
- 📋 Form Validation
- 🔢 Calculator
- 📦 Local Storage Notes App
- 🎯 Guess the Number
- ✨ And many more on the way...

## 💡 Why This Repo?

This is more than just practice—it's my personal coding playground.  
I strongly believe:
> “The best way to learn is by doing.”

Each project helps me:
- Reinforce core JavaScript concepts
- Learn debugging through real hands-on experience
- Stay consistent with coding habits

## 🤝 Contribute or Collaborate

If you're also learning and want to add your own mini project here or suggest improvements—PRs and ideas are always welcome!

## 📈 Future Goals

- [ ] Add more intermediate-level projects
- [ ] Organize projects by difficulty
- [ ] Add live demo links for each project
- [ ] Convert some projects into React/Next.js versions
